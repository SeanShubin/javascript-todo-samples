<h1>Objectives and Rules</h1>
<ul>
  <li>No Frameworks.
    <ul>
      <li>...That impose their view of the world on us.</li>
      <li>...With funny quirks that have to be worked around.</li>
      <li>...That require specialized training.</li>
      <li>...That become out-dated and hard to remove (lock in).</li>
      <li>...That are difficult to refactor in a polystylistic environment.</li>
    </ul
  </li>
  <li>Every component is a DOM object.</li>
  <li>Every component has an API similar to raw HTML object such as &lt;div>, &lt;form>, and &lt;video>.</li>
  <li>Every component generates events on self that bubble up the DOM tree.</li>
  <li>Every component responds to events on self that bubble up from children or are activated directly on it by parents.</li>
  <li>Every component should be easy to test drive.</li>
  <li>No component may reach out to the DOM except to TRIGGER events on children.</li>
  <li>All DOM objects are constructed synchronously - all non-dependent asynchronous behavior is parallel.</li>
  <li>Composition within the DOM is done using plain HTML by observing node creation.</li>
  <li>Composition of behavior is done using plan Javascript by observing events bubbling up the DOM tree.</li>
</ul>
