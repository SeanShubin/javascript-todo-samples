Try out Mocha for javascript testing
    http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/

Add clojurescript example
    https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript

Automatically fail the build if a javascript test fails
    tried integrating qunit-maven-plugin, doesn't work yet
    also created JavascriptUnitTests, but they only render the page, they don't run javascript
